def findChessboardCorners(image, chessboard):
    """
    Wrapper function for the OpenCV-Function findChessboardCornersSB() found at: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#gadc5bcb05cb21cf1e50963df26986d7c9
    Simplifies the usage of above function by directly returning unique IDs for each corner based on the used chessboard.
    Only works with OpenCV Version ∈ [3.4, 4.11]
    Numpy 2 only works with OpenCV >= 4.10.0.84, so essentially the only two compatible OpenCV-Versions are {4.10.0.84, 4.11.0.86}
    The chessboard can be defined using the dictionary below.

    When working with the Radon Checkerboard, please note:
        - The three "dotted" squares mark the finder pattern
        - There must be one white square with black dot and two black squares with white dot that define a triangle
        - Of those three markers, the white square with the black dot marks the origin
        - Orient the chessboard so that the origin is top left, with the other two markers defining the axis down and the axis right
        - Each square belongs to its top left corner
        - When determining the position of a square: Count the number of corner in the desired direction beginning at 0

    Args:
        image (numpy.ndarray):
        chessboard (dict): A dictionary representing the used chessboard
            Expected Keys:
                - 'num_corners_down' (int): Count of corners in down-direction
                - 'num_corners_down' (int): Count of corner in right-direction
                - 'origin_marker_pos_down' (int): Position of the origin marker in down-direction
                - 'origin_marker_pos_right' (int): Position of the origin marker in right-direction
